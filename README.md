## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of a lattice-based one-time signature scheme, similar to the one published by [Lyubashevsky and Micciancio](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/746.pdf). Upcoming extensions include [Boneh and Kim](https://github.com/geometry-labs/rsis/blob/dev-end-of-january/lmsigs/agg_ots/agg_ots.py) style signature aggregation, and our novel one-time adaptor signature scheme.
